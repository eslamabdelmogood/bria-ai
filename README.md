# Nahed_project
A JSON-native, AI-powered medical visualization project for breast cancer awareness and early understanding.

##Inspiration
This project was inspired by my mother, who passed away due to late-stage breast cancer caused by delayed diagnosis.
During her illness, one of the biggest challenges was not understanding how far the disease had progressed or what was happening inside the body.
This project is my way of transforming personal loss into a tool for awareness, education, and clearer medical communication.

##Problem Statement
-Breast cancer education and diagnosis often suffer from:
*Abstract explanations that are hard for patients and families to understand
-Lack of clear, consistent medical visualizations
-Over-reliance on text reports instead of interpretable visuals

##Solution Overview
This project uses Bria FIBO’s JSON-native image generation to create deterministic, medically structured visualizations of breast cancer stages.
Instead of relying on text prompts, medical intent is encoded into structured JSON describing:
-Anatomy
-Tumor location and characteristics
-Lighting and composition for clinical clarity
-This enables reproducible, explainable, and production-ready medical visuals.

##Why FIBO?
-JSON-native generation ensures full control and consistency
-Professional-grade parameters for medical accuracy
-Scalable pipelines suitable for healthcare education
-Licensed data ensures safe medical visualization


##How It Was Built
1-Designed a structured JSON schema representing breast anatomy and tumor characteristics
2-Generated medical visualization using Bria FIBO Lab / API
3-Embedded the JSON output directly into a Jupyter Notebook
4-Implemented basic AI-assisted interpretation using rule-based analysis
5-Created a reproducible notebook demonstrating the full pipeline



##Notebook
-The project includes a reproducible Jupyter Notebook:
-medical_visualization.ipynb
-Contains embedded JSON data
-Demonstrates interpretation logic
-Fully runnable without external dependencies


## Folder Explanation
### 📥 input/
Contains structured JSON files that define the medical scene, anatomy, tumor characteristics, lighting, and composition.  
These files are used as **direct input to Bria FIBO**.


---

### 📤 json_example/
Contains JSON-native outputs produced by FIBO Lab or API.  
These files represent FIBO’s structured understanding of the visual scene before image generation.
---

###  output/
Contains final images generated by the Bria FIBO model based on the structured JSON pipeline.

---

###  generate.py 
demonstrates how structured JSON scenes and FIBO outputs
can be programmatically analyzed to produce explainable medical insights.
